# Advent of Code 2022!

All of my 2022 solutions are written in Rust. Rust makes it super easy to build executables. If you would like to try out my solutions, all you will need to do is:
 - Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
 - Clone this repository
 - In your terminal (or Powershell on Windows), browse to the directory that you cloned this repo.
 - Execute the solution to a particular day's challenge: 
   - cargo run -r -p day**X**
